# 🚗 JeenyChatbot

JeenyChatbot is an intelligent, fully interactive transportation assistant designed specifically for Arabic speakers in Jordan. Built using cutting-edge technologies such as LangChain, OpenAI GPT-4-mini, and Gradio, this application provides a smart, seamless, and engaging user experience similar to popular ride-hailing services like Uber, Careem, and Jeeny.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🗣️ Intelligent Chatbot Interaction

* **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** powered by OpenAI's GPT-4-mini.
* Understands and processes user input in Jordanian Arabic dialect.
* Capable of dynamic conversational interactions, asking clarifying questions when necessary.

### ⚙️ Agentic AI

* Leverages LangChain to intelligently select and switch between tools based on context.
* Automatically manages ride details, location parsing, and car type selection.

### 🎤 Multi-modal Input/Output

* Supports both text and voice interactions.
* Advanced speech recognition and Text-to-Speech (TTS) capabilities optimized for Arabic.
* Provides real-time voice interaction for enhanced accessibility.

### 🧠 Memory Management

* Persistent conversational memory retains essential details throughout the interaction.
* Stores information such as vehicle preferences, current location, and destination.

### 📍 Saved Locations Feature

JeenyChatbot supports personalized saved locations that users can refer to using natural names. These locations are stored in the `saved_locations.json` file and are parsed intelligently by the agent during conversation.

For example, you can say:

- "خذني على الجامعة"
- "غير الموقع لـ الدار"
- "وصلني على الحديقة"

Example saved locations:
```json
{
  "الدار": "السيد مؤيد سليمان كساسبة",
  "دار جدي": "32.565279, 35.861300",
  "الجامعة": "جامعة اليرموك،",
  "المستشفى": "مستشفى الملك المؤسس عبد الله الجامعي"
}
```

### 🗺️ Interactive Maps & Dynamic Routing

* Utilizes Google Maps APIs to generate detailed trip summaries, route planning, and driver tracking.
* Interactive maps are dynamically generated using Folium, displaying trip details clearly.

### 🚘 Car Type Customization

* Allows users to choose from multiple vehicle types:

  * **Regular (عادية)**
  * **Taxi (تاكسي)**
  * **Family-sized (عائلية)**
  * **VIP (فاخرة)**
* Pricing dynamically adjusts based on vehicle choice.

### 🔄 Flexible Trip Modifications

* Enables users to modify trip details, including changing the vehicle type, start location, or destination seamlessly.
* Real-time recalculation of trip costs and timings.

### 💻 User-Friendly Interface

* Elegant, responsive, and intuitive user interface powered by Gradio.
* Easy-to-use interface with clear interaction design for broader audience accessibility.
